# Artistic Style Transfer

Artistic style transfer by convolutional neural network, inspired by Harish Narayanan's blog and the paper from Gatys et al., 2015.

## Requirements

- Python 3.5
- TensorFlow 1.0 (GPU version recommended)
- Keras
- Numpy
- SciPy
- PIL

I personally recommend you to use Anaconda to build your virtual environment. And the program probably cost a significant time if you are not using the GPU version Tensorflow.

## Demo

I'm not sure whether all the style images I used are from the public domain, so I will only show the result images. And yes, it's me.

## Acknowledgement

I would like to thank [Dr. Ray Nilanjan](https://webdocs.cs.ualberta.ca/~nray1/) for his lectures which gave my the first insight of convolutional neural network and deep learning during my undergraduate study.
